My Cloud App dotNet Challenge

Hi Everyone

So, for my challenge I was aiming for a more pure MVVM approach. Due to the lack of time (I hate excuses and this is one), I wasn't able to refine
the project as much as I wanted. I can see a lot of improvemente on some areas, adding commands to perform the actions,etc.

Anyway, this is a super simple media player.

I was able to add the Full Screen feature for images and videos, and also, to add the mousewheel zoom feature for images.

I tried to add the file info feature but I couldn't find any native way to read the info.

Thank you very much for the opportunity, and I would really appreciate any feedback.
